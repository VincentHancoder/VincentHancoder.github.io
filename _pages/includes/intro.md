# ðŸš€ About me
I am currently a third-year PhD student at Tsinghua University as a member of [IC-LAB](https://thusigsiclab.github.io/thu.github.io/), advised by Prof.[Xiu Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Xrh1OIUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). 

Previously, I received my B.Eng. Degree from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2022.

I am now working on **3D generation**, **audio generation** and **multimodal large language model (MLLM)** research. If you would like to have an academic discussion or cooperation, please feel free to email me at [hhn22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn](mailto:hhn22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn).
